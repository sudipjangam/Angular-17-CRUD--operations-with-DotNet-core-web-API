Authentication and Authorization: Optionally includes authentication and authorization mechanisms for securing endpoints and controlling access. Technologies Used: Angular 17: A powerful frontend framework for building dynamic single-page applications. .NET Core: A cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern cloud-based applications. Entity Framework Core: An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET Core, simplifying database interactions. SQL Server / MySQL / PostgreSQL: Choose your preferred database provider for storing application data. Bootstrap / Material Design: Enhance UI design and responsiveness using popular front-end frameworks. How to Use: Clone the repository to your local machine.
